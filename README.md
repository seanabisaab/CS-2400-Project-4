1. CS 2400 Project 4 done by Kevin Kim, Sean Abi Saab, and Hemil Bhavsar.
2. Kevin Kim read a sequence of integers from the input files "data_random.txt" and "data_sorted.txt" in "HeapDriver.java". He also performed heap operations and wrote the results into an output file called "outputFile.txt" in the driver program. Sean Abi Saab helped write the MaxHeapInterface.java and MaxHeap.java classes. In MaxHeap.java, he implemented two methods of building a max-heap (sequential insertion and optimal method) and the remove method of a max-heap. He also wrote and created the Javadocs for this project. Hemil Bhavsar helped write the MaxHeapInterface.java and MaxHeap.java classes.
3. For this project, we used Java interface. We also have included Javadoc that briefly explains all the methods for this project.
4. Here is the link to [the Javadoc's start page](https://seanabisaab.github.io/CS-2400-Project-4/package-summary.html).

// NOTE: In order to run our program, please have all the source codes for "HeapDriver.java", "MaxHeap.java", and "MaxHeapInterface.java" in the "src" folder. Then, please have "data_random.txt" and "data_sorted.txt" one directory before that source code folder in order to execute our driver program. The main method in "HeapDriver.java" will read sequences of integers those two text files and output the results of performing heap operations into "outputFile.txt" file.
